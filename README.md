Pinoy Cooking Basics: Frying Pork, Chicken and Fish &  a simple Lechon Kawali recipe (2nd of a series)

People learning how to cook usually start out with frying after learning how to boil an egg (I'll save that for next time!). While it may not be apparent, would you believe that there are a few fine points about simply boiling a darned egg?

The same holds even truer to frying. 

### Oil, heat and frying
For beginners, one of the least appreciated things is the importance of oil and proper heat. 

As a beginner, I always wondered why people would always heat the pan first, then heat the oil instead of just doing it in one blow. I used to just put the heat on max to get things done more quickly yet always tended to immediately drop stuff in the oil before it was properly heated. :)  It turns out that you heat the pan first to dry out any drops of water that may remain on the pan to prevent the oil from splattering :) It is always advisable to wait at least until there are slight wisps of smoke before dropping anything while serious frying generally calls for somewhat more smoke. 

It is standard to always lower the flame somewhat ( by how much depends on the dish) after you drop in the meat, chicken or fish. Proper heat regulation plays a very important part in getting it right.

Ever wonder why your sunny-side-up always seems to stick to the pan? It's not the pan folks :) It is just that your oil is not hot enough. And don't fiddle with the egg until it is nearly cooked. You should also have at least enough oil to flick some of it onto the yolk as a finishing touch. That actually took me years to figure out :)

When frying pork, chicken or fish, try not to skimp on the oil. It should ideally be deep enough to cover at least 1/4 up to 1/2 of what you are frying. On the other hand, beef usually needs only a minimum of oil. 

What turns many people off to cooking is the fear of getting splattered with oil. This is actually totally avoidable.

To avoid splatter when frying fish, try to drain it as much as possible, salt, and be sure to get the oil really hot and smoking before you slide the fish in, otherwise it will surely stick on the pan. Be sure to turn the heat down a bit once the fish is in the pan. The salt will also minimize splatter.

The oil just needs to have moderate wisps of smoke for pork and chicken.  When the meat is in the pan, turn the heat down to medium. The oil will only splatter if it is too hot, especially if the pork is rather fatty or the meat is wet.  As long as you are mindful of the heat, it will not splatter. 

 A big secret to frying is that it is not enough to simply sprinkle the salt or soak the marinade on the meat. Rather, try massaging the salt into the meat for about 3 minutes. World of difference! If you do the same with marinade, it might even be tastier than if you just soak it overnight.

When frying, strongly resist the temptation to keep turning it over and always try to do the job with just one turn-over, max twice. :)  The best sign, most noticeable with fish, is when the frying sound dies down. That is the signal to turn over. Turning it over many times tends to dry out the meat as well as increase cooking time. If the fish or meat sticks to the pan because the oil was not hot enough when you put it in, do not force it free. Just wait a minute or two longer. It will eventually come off easily when the stuck part becomes crispy. 

Beef generally does not need much oil. It is usually enough to just coat the pan or have a very thin layer of oil. Beef actually cooks quite quickly and tends to get tough and dry when over cooked. Thin slices can cook in less than a minute while thicker slices will not need more than 2 or a bit more for both sides. 

### What to fry and preparation
The most popular part for pork is the belly (liempo). This is because there is a mix of fat and meat. It is the most versatile part and can be used for just about any dish. It is generally also a bit more expensive.

However, if you are like me and are partial to chicharon-like fried pork, you might try looking for the cheek and the back of the head (batok) cuts. These have more fat and are actually the cheaper parts as well. The cheeks are particularly suited for Lechon Kawali. The batok can either be slow fried in chunks like Lechon Kawali or sliced rather thinly and simply salted and fried.

The crispy, chicharon-like result when frying more fat and skin is best achieved with medium-low heat turned up a bit higher in the last two or three minutes for pork.

 Plain cuts with little or no fat/skin (no breading or coating) need just a thin layer relatively wispy-hot oil to start although you should use more oil for pork liempo . Sear both sides for maybe 10-15 seconds to seal the juices in and prevent the meat from drying out before lowering the heat to medium. Over-frying a bit is not too bad with chicken or fish but will make pork and even more, beef, dry, tough and woody. 

For chicken, I am rather partial to just simple salting and frying as well because it tastes great anyway and doing the breaded/coated kind is more work. :)  I either dislocate the wing bone or cut it into two so that it will stay flat on the pan. The trick is in frying it  properly. Use a medium heat with plenty of oil, do not overload the pan and fry until light-medium brown and just slightly crispy. Do not over-fry as it will become dry and woody. I rather prefer the chicken back portions you can buy in the supermarket mainly because it is mostly skin, with the back end particularly delicious if fried just right.  It is also much cheaper :) 

I do prefer breaded or rather coated pork chops. Try to get at least half-inch thick cuts or more for juicier results. Beat an egg mixed with about the same or a little less amount of water. Soak the chops in it. Put flour into a plastic container with a cover about an inch deep and mix salt, pepper and whatever additional spices you might want (salt and pepper work just fine with me). 

Heat enough oil  (at least 1/3-1/2 of the width of the chop)  in a pan until slightly wispy. 

Drop a chop into the plastic container, cover and shake until the chop is fully coated. Drop the chop into the pan. Repeat for each chop. Add more flour if necessary. Use medium heat so that the coating will not be burnt before the meat is cooked. If your pan is big enough, you might be able to put in 2 or three but do not crowd. 

You can also do this for fish or chicken. Probably for beef too although I haven't tried it yet :) 

With beef, it is the cut that is important. There are cuts that definitely need an hour or two of boiling to soften up while there are really naturally more tender parts. What makes a big difference, particularly if it is not that tender is the way it is sliced. It HAS to be sliced horizontally across the fiber unless it is particularly tender. Slicing it along the length of the fiber will make otherwise acceptably tender meat tougher to chew.  You need to pay attention and tell them beforehand when buying beef at the market (in the PH) as not all vendors are aware of this. They just tend to slice away. 

Also be sure to cut away the ligaments (?), the grayish stuff around the meat, as these are also tough. These are different from fat which is delicious :) Slice the meat more thinly if the meat is not too tender. You will notice that really tender beef also slices much more easily. I also beat the meat a bit with a knife (or that hammer-like thing they call a tenderizer). 

### Quick n' easy beef recipes
While I used to be partial to the typical Pinoy beef steak, I discovered that just massaging a simple soy sauce marinade (just enough to have a few tablespoons left when it has been squeezed or it may get too salty) into the meat, squeezing it dry, browning it (medium heat, in batches) in a little oil for a minute or two, dropping the cooked pieces back in the marinade while browning the rest, then putting it all together in the pan with the marinade  and covering it for maybe five minutes is much less work and just as delicious. :) Do not overcook.  

It is the same procedure for Pinoy beef steak (bistek :) )  but with just a bit of calamansi/lemon in the marinade (not too much!) and lots of onion rings in the last 3 minutes. 

Or you can just massage maybe 2 Tablespoons of salt and 1/3 teaspoon of sugar, massage into about a half kilo of sliced beef and fry for a minute or two (medium heat, in batches) for a quick beef tapa.

### A simple recipe for Lechon Kawali
While there are a variety of styles in making this dish (Chinese, Ilocano Bagnet) these are somewhat more complicated and demanding. While they may be slightly more sophisticated in taste, I find that just keeping it nice and simple gets quite satisfactory results as well.  As usual, less seems more :)

##### Ingredients:

About 1K pork of pork cheek, either whole or in big chunks
(As it takes some time to cook, it seems like a waste of time and effort to use less. Using a whole cheek also gives a more authentic Lechon Kawali result. Chunks tend to be more chicharon-like :) )

3/4 liter coconut oil or enough to submerge the whole cheek
( Palm or Canola oil does not seem to be as satisfactory when frying)

Do not salt the meat as that will tend to dry it out and make it woody.

Heat the oil in a thick bottomed pot or deep fryer. This is to prevent the meat from sticking too firmly to the bottom Try to use something that is just wide enough to accommodate the cheek so you won't have to use too much oil. When slight wisps appear, drop the cheek gently into the pot, skin on top  and lower the heat as much as possible until only a minimum of bubbles show. No real need to cover although you may do so if you  want. 

If you hear some popping and get some oil splatter, your flame is definitely too hot. Let cook for about an hour or so then check. It might take 3 hours or more to cook properly.  If the meat sticks to the bottom, don't worry. It just means it isn't ready to turn over. It will be easy to free and turn over when it gets properly cooked.

When the bottom becomes a light golden brown, turn it over. At this point it is about 2/3 to 3/4 done. When the skin turns brown, you can raise the heat a bit (not too much!) to medium low until some bubbles appear on the skin (maybe 5-10 minutes) or until the meat turns a rich somewhat golden brown. Don't worry if the skin does not have too many bubbles as long as the color is brown (the skin will be browner than the meat) , that is good enough. Do not let the meat become too dark (too high flame) or the outside will taste a bit burnt and woody. Remove from the pot and let rest for about ten minutes before chopping it up.

Make your own vinegar dip (vinegar, garlic, salt and chili pepper) or use ketchup. Shake some salt on it if desired. 

And that's it! While it might take a rather long time to cook, actual preparation time is just maybe 2-3 minutes!

Bon apetit!
